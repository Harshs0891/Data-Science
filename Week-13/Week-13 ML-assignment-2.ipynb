    "Regularization in machine learning is a technique used to prevent overfitting, a common problem where a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise and patterns that don't generalize to new, unseen data. Regularization methods add a penalty term to the loss function, discouraging overly complex models with large coefficients. This penalty discourages the model from fitting the noise in the training data, making it generalize better to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Regularization Techniques:\n",
    "L1 Regularization (Lasso):\n",
    "How it works: L1 regularization adds the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients to the loss function. It encourages sparsity by forcing some coefficients to become exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n",
    "Use case: Useful when you suspect that only a subset of features is relevant, as it can automatically perform feature selection.\n",
    "L2 Regularization (Ridge):\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works: L2 regularization adds the sum of the squares of the coefficients to the loss function. It penalizes large coefficients but doesn't force them to zero, promoting a smoother solution.\n",
    "Use case: Helps when all features are potentially relevant, as it discourages any single feature from having too much influence.\n",
    "Elastic Net Regularization:\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works: Elastic Net combines both L1 and L2 regularization terms in the loss function. It balances between feature selection (L1) and handling correlated features (L2).\n",
    "Use case: Useful when there are many correlated features and you want to perform feature selection while handling multicollinearity.\n",
    "Dropout (Neural Networks):\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works: Dropout is a technique used in neural networks. During training, randomly selected neurons are ignored, effectively removing them from the network for that iteration. It prevents co-adaptation of neurons and reduces overfitting.\n",
    "Use case: Particularly effective in deep neural networks where overfitting is a common issue.\n",
    "Early Stopping:\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works: During training, monitor the model's performance on a validation dataset. Training is halted when the validation performance starts degrading, preventing the model from learning the noise in the training data.\n",
    "Use case: Suitable when the model's performance on validation data indicates overfitting.\n",
    "Cross-Validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works: Dividing the dataset into multiple folds and training the model on different subsets, allowing for a robust evaluation of its performance across various data partitions.\n",
    "Use case: Helps assess how well the model generalizes to different subsets of data, giving insights into potential overfitting issues."
