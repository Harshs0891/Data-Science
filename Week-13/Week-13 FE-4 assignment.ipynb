    "**Target Guided Ordinal Encoding** is a technique used for encoding categorical variables where the categories are assigned numerical labels based on their impact on the target variable. In other words, the categories are ranked or ordered according to their mean or median of the target variable, and these rankings are then used as the numerical labels for the encoding. This approach leverages the relationship between the categorical variable and the target variable, making it especially useful when the categorical variable strongly influences the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step explanation of how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calculate the Mean or Median for Each Category**: Compute the mean or median of the target variable for each category of the categorical variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Order Categories by Mean or Median**: Rank the categories based on their mean or median values. The category with the highest mean or median gets the lowest label, and the category with the lowest mean or median gets the highest label.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Assign Ordinal Labels**: Assign numerical labels to the categories based on their rankings.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Replace Categorical Values**: Replace the original categorical values in the dataset with the newly assigned numerical labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of when you might use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding in a machine learning project:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Scenario: Customer Segmentation for an E-commerce Platform\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a dataset for customer segmentation with features like \"Product Category,\" \"Average Purchase Amount,\" and \"Customer Satisfaction Level.\" The goal is to predict customer segments based on these features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Product Category**: Categorical variable with categories like \"Electronics,\" \"Clothing,\" \"Home & Kitchen,\" etc.\n",
    "- **Customer Satisfaction Level**: Categorical variable with categories like \"Low,\" \"Medium,\" \"High.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, the \"Product Category\" strongly influences both the \"Average Purchase Amount\" and \"Customer Satisfaction Level.\" You want to capture this relationship while encoding the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps for Target Guided Ordinal Encoding**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the average purchase amount and customer satisfaction level for each product category.\n",
    "2. Order the product categories based on their average purchase amount (or customer satisfaction level).\n",
    "3. Assign numerical labels to the product categories according to their rankings.\n",
    "4. Replace the original product category values with the new numerical labels in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "By encoding \"Product Category\" using Target Guided Ordinal Encoding, you capture the relationship between the product categories and customer behavior, allowing your machine learning model to potentially leverage this information for accurate customer segmentation. Remember, the effectiveness of this technique heavily depends on the strength of the relationship between the categorical variable and the target variable."
