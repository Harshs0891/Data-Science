    "### Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization):\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works: Lasso regression adds an L1 regularization term to the linear regression loss function. It encourages sparsity in the coefficient vector, effectively performing feature selection by setting some coefficients to zero.\n",

    "How it works: Ridge regression adds an L2 regularization term to the linear regression loss function. While it doesn't enforce sparsity like Lasso, it penalizes large coefficients, effectively reducing the impact of less relevant features.\n",
    "Use case: Useful when all features are potentially relevant. It helps in preventing overfitting and indirectly influences feature importance.\n",
    "### Elastic Net Regression:\n",

    "1. **Data Exploration:**\n",
    "   - Understand the dataset thoroughly, including the meaning and type of each attribute.\n",
    "   - Identify the target variable, which in this case is whether a customer churned or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Correlation Analysis:**\n",
    "   - Calculate correlation coefficients between each feature and the target variable (churn). Features with high absolute correlation values are good candidates for inclusion in the model.\n",
    "   - Consider using techniques like Pearson correlation coefficient for numerical features and point-biserial correlation for binary features.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "6. **Variance Thresholding:**\n",
    "   - If your dataset contains numerical features, you can use variance thresholding to remove low-variance features. Features with low variance generally do not carry much information and can be filtered out.\n",

    "- Split the dataset into training and validation sets. Train the selected algorithm (Lasso regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting) on the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Extract Feature Importance:**\n",
    "- For tree-based algorithms, extract feature importance scores after the model is trained. These scores indicate the contribution of each feature to the model's predictive power.\n",
    "- For Lasso regression, non-zero coefficient features represent the selected features.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Choose a regression algorithm suitable for your task, such as linear regression, decision trees, or ensemble methods like Random Forest.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 6. **Select the Best Subset:**\n",
    "- Evaluate the performance of each feature subset using the chosen performance metric. The subset that results in the lowest error (MSE or RMSE) is considered the best set of features for your predictor.\n",
