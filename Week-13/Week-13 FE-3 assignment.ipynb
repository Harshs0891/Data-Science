    "Nominal encoding and one-hot encoding are both techniques used to convert categorical variables into a numerical format, but they serve different purposes. Nominal encoding assigns a unique integer to each category, while one-hot encoding creates binary columns for each category, indicating the presence or absence of the category with 1s and 0s, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nominal encoding is preferred over one-hot encoding in the following situations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **When dealing with high cardinality features**: One-hot encoding can lead to a large number of binary columns, especially when a categorical feature has many unique categories. This can significantly increase the dimensionality of the dataset, making it computationally expensive and potentially leading to the curse of dimensionality. In such cases, nominal encoding can be a more space-efficient alternative.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**: Consider a dataset containing a feature like \"Product Category,\" which has hundreds or thousands of unique categories. One-hot encoding this feature would create an impractical number of binary columns. Using nominal encoding by assigning unique integers to each category can be more manageable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **When the categorical variable doesn't carry a specific order or hierarchy**: Nominal encoding is suitable for categorical variables where there is no meaningful order or ranking among the categories. If the categories have no inherent ordinal relationship, using nominal encoding is a reasonable choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**: In the \"Product Category\" example, if the categories are types of fruits (e.g., \"Apple,\" \"Banana,\" \"Orange\"), there is no inherent order. Nominal encoding can be used to represent these categories numerically without implying any hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **When interpretability of the model is not a primary concern**: Nominal encoding simplifies the feature space, making the model easier to interpret compared to one-hot encoding. If the main goal is to build a predictive model, especially for algorithms that can handle numeric inputs well, nominal encoding might be preferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**: In a machine learning model predicting customer preferences based on various features, if one of the features is \"Preferred Social Media Platform\" (with categories like \"Facebook,\" \"Instagram,\" \"Twitter\"), nominal encoding can be applied, and the model can efficiently learn patterns from these numerical representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the choice between nominal encoding and one-hot encoding depends on the specific dataset and the goals of the analysis. Understanding the nature of the categorical variables and the requirements of the machine learning algorithms being used is essential in making an informed decision."

    "\n",
    "### 1. **Gender (Binary Categorical)**:\n",

    "label_encoder = LabelEncoder()\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Contract Type (Multiple Categories)**:\n",
    "The 'Contract Type' feature likely has multiple categories (e.g., Month-to-month, One year, Two year). For this, you can use **One-Hot Encoding** since there's no ordinal relationship among the contract types.\n",

    "```python\n",

    "Monthly charges and tenure are already numerical, so there's no need for encoding here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Age (Numerical Feature)**:\n",
    "Age is also numerical, so there's no need for encoding here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Combining Encoded Features**:\n",
    "Now, you have `encoded_gender` (from label encoding) and `contract_type_encoded` (from one-hot encoding) as new features. Combine these with the original numerical features (age, monthly charges, tenure) to create the final dataset for your machine learning model.\n",
