    "Levels of measurement, also known as scales of measurement or data measurement scales, refer to a way of classifying and categorizing the types of data we encounter in statistics and research.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Nominal Level*** :- At this level data is categorized in such a way that it do not have any inherent order or ranking. ***Example*** :- Color of hair\n",
    "\n",
    "***Ordinal Level Of Measurement*** :- At this level data is categorized in a such way that ot does have ranking and data can be ranked accordingly.\n",
    "***Example*** :- grade of students in class\n",
    "\n",
    "***Interval Level of measurement*** :- At this level, data has a meaningful order, and the intervals between values are equal and meaningful. However, there is no true zero point. ***Example*** :- Temperature in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit. While you can say that 20°C is 10°C warmer than 10°C, you can't say there is \"zero\" temperature because 0°C or 0°F does not represent an absence of temperature but rather a reference point.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Ratio Level of measurement***:- Ratio data has all the characteristics of interval data, but it also has a true zero point, where zero means the complete absence of the characteristic being measured. This allows for meaningful ratios between values. ***Example*** :- Height in centimeters, weight in kilograms, age in years. In each of these cases, a value of zero (0 cm, 0 kg, 0 years) represents the absence of height, weight, or age, making meaningful ratio comparisons possible."

    "1. It helps us to determine the right use of right statistical techniques.\n",
    "***Example*** :- For exit polls inferential statistics is used\n",
    "\n",

    "***Example*** :- if u are analyzing data of customer satisfaction we will need to use Likert scale(ordinal data) for better interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. it influences choosing the right visualization and graph.\n",
    "***Example*** :-  If you're visualizing the distribution of educational attainment (ordinal data) among survey respondents, using a bar chart with categories ordered from low to high makes sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Helps in data interpretation\n",
    "***Example*** :-  If you have a dataset of product ratings on a scale from 1 to 5 (ordinal data), stating that the \"average rating is 3.7\" might mislead people into thinking it represents a precise measure when it doesn't. Instead, you should use median or mode for ordinal data."
